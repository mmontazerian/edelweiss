                    Confidentiality is a vital aspect of the patient-therapist relationship, built on trust as sensitive
                    subjects
                    are
                    discussed during therapy. Typically, your therapist cannot share information about you unless you
                    provide a
                    release
                    of information. However, state laws and ethical standards may require therapists to break
                    confidentiality in
                    certain situations:
                    1. Suspected past or present abuse of children, adults, or elders, which must be reported to the
                    appropriate
                    authorities, such as child protection and law enforcement, based on the patient's information and
                    corroborating
                    sources.
                    2. If the therapist has reason to believe the patient is at serious risk of self-harm or poses a
                    threat to harm
                    others.

                    You have the right to receive a “Good Faith Estimate” explaining how much your medical and mental

                    will
                    cost. Under the law, health care providers need to give patients who don’t have insurance or who are
                    not using
                    insurance an estimate of the expected charges for medical services, including psychotherapy

                    the

                    services,
                    including psychotherapy services. You can ask your health care provider, and any other provider you

                    a

                    Good
